# CS110 Final Exam

## SHORT DESCRIPTION *(User chooses between two options of either however many cat facts the user wants or a random anime picture, where they choose the type and category the picture comes from.)*

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS *(Cat facts sometimes breaks when you choose a big number because it either runs out of facts or it returns invalid command. I also tried to open the png automatically wth the command "with open" but it didnt work.)*

## REFERENCES *(I did try to reference a youtube video to open the anime picture and a png after the command was executed but it didnt work. Didnt include the NSFW options... because its not safe for work.)*

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS *(please don't select the NSFW options please. Just don't, I programmed it in but I just don't want people to choose it as an option. Also the list provided doesn't have all the NSFW options cause I really didn't want to include them)*
