# CS110 Midterm Exam

## Description
My turlte draws the crest of cethleann from fire emblem three houses. It takes advantage of the multiple curves of the crest by using the circle function and drawing incomplete circles in either clockwise or counterclockwise. Tried to be as accurate as I could be to the game but the curves were too advanced for me to figure it out. 
## Known Bugs or Imcomplete Parts
I wanted to add a scale part where the user could decide how big the picture was but implementing it didn't workout as it breaks the shape due to wrong proportions. I also want to calibrate it so that it works with whatever radius you give it and not break. 
## References 
None
## Miscellaneous Stuff
I wanted to do a different crest but they were too advanced and required different sizes of lines do I choice cethleann instead. I wanted to do crest of flames or blaiddyd but it was too complex and curved too much.
